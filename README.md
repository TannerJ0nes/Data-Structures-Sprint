This is my final Sprint Project at Keyin Collage. To Access the project Run the Main File Called BinarySearchTreeVisualizerApplication, then go to localhost:8080/enter-numbers

Then to use the application Enter a string of numbers in the format of 1,2,3,4,5 a tree will be displayed with a link to the main page as well as the main page
has a link to go to view trees generated in that session!
